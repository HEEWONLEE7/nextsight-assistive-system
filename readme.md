# Development of an AI-Based Assistive Eyewear System for Safe Walking of the Visually Impaired 👓  

## Overview  
**NEXT SIGHT** is an intelligent assistive walking system designed for the visually impaired.  
It integrates a camera, LiDAR, flex sensors, and a Large Language Model (LLM)  
to perceive the surrounding environment and provide real-time feedback for safe walking.  

This project was conducted as part of the **Capstone Design Course (Spring 2025)**  
at **Kwangwoon University, Department of Robotics**,  
and was awarded the **Grand Prize at the 2025 HOPE Project**.
